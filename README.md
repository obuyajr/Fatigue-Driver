Driver Fatigue Alert System
Introduction
Driver fatigue is a leading cause of accidents on the road. In order to help prevent these accidents, a Driver Fatigue Alert System has been developed. This system is designed to detect signs of fatigue in a driver and alert them before an accident can occur.

Features
The Driver Fatigue Alert System has the following features:

Real-time detection of driver fatigue through the use of sensors
An alert system that notifies the driver when fatigue is detected
A dashboard that shows the driver their level of fatigue over time
An adjustable sensitivity setting that allows the system to be customized to the driver's needs
How it Works
The Driver Fatigue Alert System uses a combination of sensors to detect signs of fatigue in a driver. These sensors include a camera that tracks the driver's eye movements, a microphone that monitors their breathing patterns, and a motion sensor that detects any sudden changes in the car's movement.

When the system detects signs of fatigue, it will activate an alert. The alert can be in the form of an audible beep, a visual warning on the dashboard, or a vibration in the driver's seat. The alert will continue until the system detects that the driver is no longer fatigued.

The system also includes a dashboard that shows the driver their level of fatigue over time. This allows the driver to see when they are most likely to become fatigued and take appropriate action to prevent it.

Installation
The Driver Fatigue Alert System can be installed in any car with minimal effort. The system consists of a small camera, microphone, and motion sensor that can be easily mounted in the car. The system is powered by the car's battery and can be easily connected to the car's dashboard.

Conclusion
The Driver Fatigue Alert System is an effective tool for preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue. By using a combination of sensors to detect signs of fatigue, the system can alert drivers before an accident can occur. The system is easy to install and can be customized to the driver's needs.
